                 <p>  This is app was built with IOS and swift 3, The idea was to leverage Corelocation and Mapkit libraries capabilities to build a LoperMarked
                    location and details on the map with annotations .
                   Using Mapkit Location manager the app can get the user current's position and the lopermarked address coordinates.
